The message: 
I think the authors were trying to depict the actual number of whale entanglement observations found, each month colored by year (individual years can be seen in the figure). 

Problems: 
1. Visulaisation is faulty - the information is overlapping and difficult to read. 
2. The colour scheme is okay but would look better with a more contrasting colour scheme as the ombre sees several colours looking the exact same making it difficult to differentiate.  

Caption: 
The total monthly observed entanglements of whales annually from 1990 to 2021, but with better visualisation and colourscheme.
